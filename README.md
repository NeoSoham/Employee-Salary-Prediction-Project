🚀 EMPLOYEE SALARY PREDICTION
🎯 A machine learning web app to predict whether an employee earns >50K or ≤50K based on personal and professional attributes. Built using Streamlit, trained on the UCI Adult Income Dataset.

📦 PROJECT OVERVIEW
🔍 This project aims to:

Classify employee salary range (>50K or ≤50K)

Leverage preprocessing techniques (Encoding, Scaling, PCA)

Utilize a trained machine learning model

Provide an interactive web interface using Streamlit

Visualize feature importance and model performance
